Practice_01 The first excercise in version control
8/15/2019
USe file manager to navigate to the place where your repository will be
right click
Select "Git Bash Here" this opens a command line where we will enter the version control commands
create a new file (a txt file is a good one to practice with)
go to the bash command window and type
$ git init - this adds the git application to the folder we are working
now add the new txt file to the local git repository by typing
$ git add - now the new file is connected to the git tools
now edit the text file. Add a few lines. Notepad++ is a good choice
when all done editing and ready to lock down, type
$git commit <filename> -m "note to explain changes and yout initials"
don't forget the -m it is easier to do it this way. Otherwise you get an awakward text editor to deal with
if you get that editor. you type the message at the top then :wq to exit out.
now your txt file is locked down in the local git repository
now it is time to send the file to the cloud or remote repository so others can access it.
to do do this type
$git push <filename>

in between steps, type
$git status 
to see what stage the files are in
