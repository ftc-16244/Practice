There was a dude that had a bunch of slaves and beat them all. Eventually they revolted and they through him in his own fireplace.
They then through a party that symbolized them revolting. Then they lead their own lives.
Present Time: There were 3 kids that decided to go exploring an old run-down house at the end of their street. It had a long
history of very violent deaths.There was micheal that was the leader of the group, then tucker who was micheal's best friend,
and then there was tyler which no one took seriously. They entered the house on a very stormy day. When they went inside it was 
pitch black. There were spider webs everywhere, then... the door slammed shut. They ran back trying to open it the harder they pulled
the more it got stuck. They flicked on their flashlights and decided to explore the giant mansion.
